I was really fond of the well written [Neural Networks and Deep Learning online book.](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen. To help my understanding I want to write some notes from his book. But instead of just writing his book in bullet form I want to try something else. Writing my notes in a [*discovery fiction*](https://michaelnotebook.com/df/index.html) type of format. Basically writing in a way where I my self discover Neural Networks by trying to solve a problem.

 ## The problem

 There are multiple algorithms solving different problems. blah blah
